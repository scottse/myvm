# myvm


myvm is a script designed to either create a "quick VM" or a custom VM from
cloud VM images from Debian, Ubuntu, Centos, Fedora, and OpenSUSE. The quick VM option has predefined
variables for disk size, amount of memory, number of vCPUs, etc. 

Requirements:
The script needs virt-install and cloud-localds packages to be installed.
